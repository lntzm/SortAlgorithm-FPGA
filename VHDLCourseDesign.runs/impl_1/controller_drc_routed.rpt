2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net data0_reg[7]_i_2_n_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin data0_reg[7]_i_2/O, cell data0_reg[7]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net data1_reg[7]_i_1_n_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin data1_reg[7]_i_1/O, cell data1_reg[7]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net data2_reg[7]_i_1_n_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin data2_reg[7]_i_1/O, cell data2_reg[7]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net data3_reg[7]_i_1_n_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin data3_reg[7]_i_1/O, cell data3_reg[7]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net data4_reg[7]_i_1_n_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin data4_reg[7]_i_1/O, cell data4_reg[7]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net data5_reg[7]_i_1_n_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin data5_reg[7]_i_1/O, cell data5_reg[7]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#7 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net leds_reg[5]_i_2_n_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin leds_reg[5]_i_2/O, cell leds_reg[5]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#8 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net num0_reg[7]_i_2_n_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin num0_reg[7]_i_2/O, cell num0_reg[7]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>
